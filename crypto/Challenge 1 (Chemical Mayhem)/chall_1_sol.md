# Challenge 1 (Chemical Mayhem)

first, i looked at the python file given. there was a xor function, so i can probably use it.

the challenge said: "I remember that I was mixing one chemical and one compound before the flag was dissolved..."

so i probaby have to xor the chemicals, compounds and the flag together in order to reverse the xor function and get the flag. 

i brute forced it in my code to get the flag, `YCEP2023{x0R_oP3rAt10Ns_aR3_c0NFuS1nG}`!
